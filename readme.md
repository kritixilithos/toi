#Toi

This is an implementation of [Toi](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Toi), a language by esolangs user oklopol, in Dyalog APL.

This implementation does not implement base-10 numbers to represent their respective von Neumann numerals, and does not implement the error set. Any invalid character is ignored. Docs can be found in the esolangs page.
